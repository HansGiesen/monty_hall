# Monty Hall Simulator

This repository contains a script that runs a simulation of the Monty Hall problem.  After downloading the repository, you can run the script as follows:
```
$./mh.py
```

By default, it repeats the problem 10,000 times, and the decision whether to switch is random with a probability of 0.5.  The number of plays and switching probability can be altered using the '-n' and '-p' commandline options respectively.

Note that this implementation focuses on readability rather than speed.
